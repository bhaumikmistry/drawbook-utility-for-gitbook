# drawbook-utility-for-gitbook
There is no easy way to display images in a gitbook as a drawing book, without adding one .md file for each image manually. This utility should help it make the step easier.

# Things to do
- ~~List all the folders in the given path~~
- ~~List all the files in the given path~~
- for each file in the current folder
    - add file name to README.md in current path
    - create a .md file with image file name
    - add text to display that image
    - move the file to /src
    - log this info into the current log file with date time.
